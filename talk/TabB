Terminal does not support AddHistory.

There seems to be running another CPAN process (pid 15784).  Contacting...
Other job is running.
Shall I try to run in downgraded mode? (Y/n) [y] n

You may want to kill the other job and delete the lockfile. On UNIX try:
    kill 15784
    rm /home/mo/.cpan/.lock
