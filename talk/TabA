[0mThe goal of the CPAN Testers project (http://testers.cpan.org/) is to
test as many CPAN packages as possible on as many platforms as
possible.  This provides valuable feedback to module authors and
potential users to identify bugs or platform compatibility issues and
improves the overall quality and value of CPAN.

One way you can contribute is to send test results for each module
that you install.  If you install the CPAN::Reporter module, you have
the option to automatically generate and deliver test reports to CPAN
Testers whenever you run tests on a CPAN package.

See the CPAN::Reporter documentation for additional details and
configuration settings.  If your firewall blocks outgoing traffic,
you may need to configure CPAN::Reporter before sending reports.

 <test_report>
Generate test reports if CPAN::Reporter is installed (yes/no)? [yes] 

Would you like me configure CPAN::Reporter now? [yes] 


Proceeding to configure CPAN::Reporter.

Some of the following configuration options require one or more "grade:action"
pairs that determine what grade-specific action to take for that option.
These pairs should be space-separated and are processed left-to-right. See
CPAN::Reporter documentation for more details.

    GRADE   :   ACTION  ======> EXAMPLES
    -------     -------         --------
    pass        yes             default:no
    fail        no              default:yes pass:no
    unknown     ask/no          default:ask/no pass:yes fail:no
    na          ask/yes
    default

CPAN::Reporter requires a valid email address to identify senders
in the body of a test report.  Please use a standard email format
like: "John Doe" <jdoe@example.com>

email_from? [yes] bullyproof.insurance@gmail                          

Before test reports are sent, you may want to review or edit the test
report and add additional comments about the result or about your system
or Perl configuration.  By default, CPAN::Reporter will ask after
each report is generated whether or not you would like to edit the
report. This option takes "grade:action" pairs.

(Recommended: 'default:ask/no pass/na:no')

edit_report? [pass] 

By default, CPAN::Reporter will prompt you for confirmation that
the test report should be sent before actually doing it. This
gives the opportunity to skip sending particular reports if
you need to (e.g. if you caused the failure). This option takes
"grade:action" pairs.

(Recommended: 'default:ask/yes pass/na:yes')

send_report? [yes] 

CPAN::Reporter sends your reports over HTTPS using Metabase. This option lets
you set a different uri, transport mechanism and metabase profile path. If you
are receiving HTTPS errors, you may change the uri to use plain HTTP, though
this is not recommended. Unless you know what you're doing, just accept
the default value.

(Recommended: 'Metabase uri https://metabase.cpantesters.org/api/v1/ id_file metabase_id.json')

transport? [yes] 

CPAN::Reporter: error loading Test::Reporter::Transport::yes. Please install the missing module or choose a different transport mechanism.


CPAN::Reporter: writing config file to '/home/mo/.cpanreporter/config.ini'.

Returning to CPAN configuration.

Please remember to call 'o conf commit' to make the config permanent!
